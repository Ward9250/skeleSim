**SkeleSim** package

Installation.  Right now the package runs as a shiny app. The app is
located in the subdirectory inst/shiny/skeleSimShinyGUI.  

Basically, you need to make sure the dependencies are installed (installing the skeleSim package enforces this) and then issue:
 libary(skeleSim)
 skeleSimGUI()

See the README in that
folder for additional information.
