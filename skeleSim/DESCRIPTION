Description: SkeleSim is a tool to guide users in choosing
    appropriate simulations, setting parameters, calculating summary genetic
    statistics, and organizing data output, all within the R environment.
    Skelesim is designed to be an extensible environment that can 'wrap' around
    any simulation software to increase its accessibility and use.
